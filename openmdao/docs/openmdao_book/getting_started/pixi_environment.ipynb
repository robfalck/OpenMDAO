    "# Using Pixi for reproducable environments\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMDAO requires a number of dependencies to fully take advantage of its capabilities. Sometimes finding versions of dependencies which are compatible and are known to function correctly is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMDAO uses [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) for dependency management. Pixi is especially useful because some OpenMDAO dependencies (like MPI, PETSc) are not available on PyPI but are needed for parallel computing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Pixi allows users and developers to get consistent, reproducable environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Pixi\n",
    "\n",
    "Before users can utilize Pixi, it needs to be installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the Pixi environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixi stores information about OpenMDAO environments in a _manifest_ file (`pixi.toml`) and a _lock_ file (`pixi.lock`) in the root directory of the OpenMDAO git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent is that the lock file will be tested in our CI machinery, and should provide a consistent environment for as many of our users as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users who want to develop OpenMDAO itself can setup the Pixi environments from the cloned repository."
